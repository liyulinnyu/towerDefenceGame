# towerDefenceGame

I just spent one day to create this easy game by using about 1000 lines of JS code. Maybe you will think the pictures which I choose to create the game map are a little bit ugly or simple. But I think it doesn't matter, after all, I'm not an artist~ hahaha. Ok, you can also create a tower defence game by youself. You can see my JS code, and I write many annotations in the JS file. Whatever questions, please contact me.

How to play the game?

(1) Open the HTML file, the game will start automatically(please use PC terminal, not mobile terminal). In the game page, you can see 5 kinds of towers(left), every tower has different ATK and attack range. And the middle area is the map of this game, you can see some monsters walk out one by one, your responsibility is to kill them, every monster has different speed, height, blood. You can also see your blood(right) ¡ª three pink heart pictures, if you let one monster leave the map, your heart will decrease by 1. The game will over if your blood turns to zero. 

(2) I set 10 sets of monsters, and each of sets has 10 monsters. The next sets of monsters will not walk out until you have killed the current monsters. Each group will have more blood than the previous group.  After 10 sets of monsters, a big king monster will walk out with more than 2000 blood, how can you kill it!?? Haaaaaaa! Just try it!

(3)How to create towers in the map? Easy! Just click one of towers you want to create. After that, you will see every brown area(if there has no tower before) has a translucant plus sign on it. In this step, you can click anywhere with plus sign to create the tower you have already chosen. After creating, all plus signs will disappear. And the towers will attack the monsters automatically.

(4)How to destroy a tower? Maybe sometimes you just want to recreate a tower, but how to destroy the tower?  Just click the tower which has already been created, and it will show an "x" sign(delete sign) on this tower, what you should do is click it, and the tower will disappear, so easy! And after that you can recreate a tower.

(5)You can also stop/begin this game by click the button on the top right.

Ok, this game has just one map, if you want to replay, just reload the page or press "F5" on your keyborad. You can also create more maps for this game, or you can create your own tower defence game. Old saying, whatever questions, please don't hesitate, just contact to me, thank you so much.
